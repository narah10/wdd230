        <h1>Welcome to West Seattle</h1>
        <p class="little-title">About Us</p>
        <p>
          West Seattle is located at the westernmost point of the city of
          Seattle, and offers spectacular views of the Olympic Mountains to the
          west and the Cascade Range to the east. This historic neighborhood is
          composed of several smaller micro-neighborhoods, including Admiral,
          Fauntleroy, and Delridge. The thread that ties them all together?
          People march to the beat of their own drum here, and don't seem to
          mind being connected to Seattle mainly by bridge.

        <h2>Around The Block</h2>
        <h3>West Seattle:</h3>
        <p>
          West Seattle is most well-known for the iconic Denny Party landing of
          1851, where the New Yorkers first met a group of Duwamish Indians led
          by chief Si'ahl (Seattle later became his namesake). As the
          neighborhood has grown, it has fiercely advocated for funding to add
          bridges, highways, and ferries to facilitate easy access to the rest
          of Seattle. Paradoxically, it has also maintained a strong desire to
          stay rooted in its independence. This self-sufficient attitude is what
          makes West Seattle a great place to live -- you could leave, but with
          such excellent amenities, dining options, and beautiful parks, you
          might not even want to.
        </p>
        <h3>What To Expect:</h3>
        <p class="little-title">A small town with big city conveniences.</p>
        <p>
          If you ask people who don't live in West Seattle, they might say that
          it feels isolated from the city, but the area's actual residents say
          that as long as you avoid rush hour, it's the perfect place to be.
          West Seattle is most accurately summed up as a “small town with big
          city conveniences”. Residents enjoy easy access to grocery stores,
          shops, and schools by foot, and a well-connected public transportation
          system for everywhere else. People here are down-to-earth, tend to
          dress casually, and are very friendly. Recent developments have locals
          comparing it to an up-and-coming Ballard, with a beach-town twist.
        </p>

        <h3>The Lifestyle:</h3>
        <p class="little-title">
          For those lucky few who aren't too pressed for time.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be difficult to find a more iconic way to spend a Seattle
          evening than at a bonfire on Alki beach. First, stop by Pegasus Pizza,
          a casual institution whose homemade crust is only enhanced by the
          sounds and smells of the ocean next door. Tom's Special pizza features
          shredded pepperoni, and is described exclusively with superlatives.
          Once you're fed, snag a rental bike and enjoy the cool evening air as
          you ride along the water. Breathe deep. Watch as the sun sets behind
          the horizon and as the skyline melts into twinkling night lights.
        </p>
        <h3>Unexpected Appeal:</h3>
        <p class="little-title">
          A charming place where you'll want to eat around the block.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intersection of Alaska Street and California Avenue serves as West
          Seattle's downtown, and it's where you can find a week's worth of
          shopping, dining, concerts, and more. It is affectionately called “The
          Junction”, or sometimes “Alaska Junction”, and is chock-full of the
          most unique, drool-inducing eateries you've ever seen. For an
          extraordinary selection of tap beers and bottles, The Beer Junction is
          a must-visit. This tap house features over 1,300 types of cold beer
          and an equally chilled atmosphere. If it's something sweet, buttery,
          and flaky you're after, Bakery Nouveau is the place to be. We hear the
          twice baked chocolate croissant is divine.
        </p>
        <h3>You'll Fall In Love With:</h3>
        <p class="little-title">Doing things your own way.</p>
        <p>
          People who are attracted to West Seattle tend to be those who
          effortlessly shrug off the yoke of conformity. They are often ahead of
          trends, and don't mind straying off the beaten path, because they know
          the rewards are great. The Denny Party may have first landed over a
          century ago, but the creative, adventurous spirit they brought lives
          on in West Seattle.

          <h4>Fun facts on West Seattle</h4>
          <p>
            West Seattle is the oldest and the biggest of Seattle's neighborhoods is both a peninsula and a state of mind. The first Euro-American settlers arrived here (on Alki Point) in 1851, but left within a few months, moving to a more agreeable location on the other side of Elliott Bay (the site of present-day downtown Seattle). Orphaned at an early age, isolated by water on three sides, West Seattle has clung to its cultural independence, remaining determinedly aloof even while fighting tenaciously for the bridges, highways, and ferries that have brought it closer to its sprawling neighbor to the east. <strong>The current population is 27, 055.</strong>
